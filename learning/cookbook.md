# Cookbook

> This guide is currently a work in progress. If you'd like to help out, check out the [Contributing guide](../contributing.md) to get started!

This section of the Atlas is devoted to in depth guides for using Ember, or Ember related libraries. Some ideas for good cookbook "recipes" could be:

* A guide to configuring several addons to work together
* A guide for setting up a Docker-based build/deployment system for Ember apps
* A guide to in-depth customizations to a popular addon, such as [ember-power-select](https://ember-power-select.com/)
* A guide to using a non-Ember library \(which doesn't have existing Ember guides\) with Ember apps

We don't have any recipes yet, but if you have ideas for some, ping us in \#dev-ember-learning on [Discord](https://discord.gg/emberjs)!
