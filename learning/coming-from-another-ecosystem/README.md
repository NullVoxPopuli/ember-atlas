# Coming From Another Ecosystem?

As a component-based framework, Ember shares a lot in common with other frontend frameworks and libraries, such as React or Vue. If you're already familiar with another frontend framework, you may want to skip the basics and figure out exactly how the concepts you already know translate to Ember. That's what these guides are for!

Currently we have guides for:

{% page-ref page="ember-for-react-developers.md" %}

We would also like to add guides for the following frameworks:

* Vue \(and Nuxt\)
* Angular 1
* Angluar 2+

If you would like to write guides for any of these, or any other framework, check out the [Contributing](../../contributing.md) page to get started!
