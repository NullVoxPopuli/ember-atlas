# Contributing

The Ember Atlas is always looking for new contributions! Whether you noticed a typo, or have a link to add to a list, or want to write a whole new guide, we're open to any and all changes!

Currently, the Atlas is based on GitBook. This platform gives us a nice UI, editor, and widgets, and allows us to sync the Atlas back to a Git repository. In order to use the GitBook editor, you have to sign up and be given writer permissions. To get these, ping us in the \#dev-ember-learning channel on the [Ember Community Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/zT3asNS), or email: [opensource@pzuraq.com](mailto:opensource@pzuraq.com).

You can also submit PRs on [the Github repository](https://github.com/ember-atlas/ember-atlas). GitBook primarily uses Markdown for its formatting, with some custom macros for widgets like tabs. Markdown files can always be a starting point and can be improved on later, so this method is also encouraged!

### What to Contribute?

The goal of the Atlas is to cover as much as possible, so we're open to most things! Some ideas for possible contributions are:

* New guides. If you've searched for a guide on an Ember related topic just to find nothing, or if you ever thought that existing guides didn't go into enough detail and could use more content, it would probably be a great addition to the Atlas.
* Edits, revisions, and expansions to existing guides. If you think something is confusing, poorly worded, wrong, or could use more detail, updating it would be a great contribution.
* Links to external resources, such as trainings, courses, guides, and blog posts.
* Adaptations of existing resources. In particular, blog posts, which often can become outdated, may make sense to adapt for inclusion in the Atlas. See the section below for more details on this. 

If you're wondering whether or not something would be an appropriate addition, ping us in the \#dev-ember-learning channel on the [Ember Community Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/zT3asNS) or email: [opensource@pzuraq.com](mailto:opensource@pzuraq.com).

#### Adapting Existing Content

Sometimes it may make sense to adapt an existing external resource, such as a guide or blog post, for inclusion in the Atlas. In general, if the resource:

* Is still relevant to Ember today
* Is popular or commonly used
* Could use more detail, or could be expanded upon
* Needs to be updated to reflect changes in Ember's APIs and best practices
* Is no longer being updated by the original authors

Then it is a great candidate for adaptation. When adapting, make sure to reference the original resource directly via a link near the beginning of the page so that the original authors receive due credit.
